It's a pity that this line is not supported anymore on Windows, thankfully it's trivial to make use of it under linux.

## Prerequisites

Apart from windows you'll need linux vm or a physical device, unless there is a way to run gnomad2 on windows (have not been investigating this)

+ Creative a Zen Micro
+ Some linux OS
+ A bit of Powershell

## Howto

Make use of linux, and install following package

```bash
sudo apt install gnomad2
```

Then connect your mp3 player, and share data back na forth. The user interface left much to be desired but still it's much better than no chances to exchange data back and forth.

## Howto modify the file tags

Make use of [powershell-taglib](https://github.com/illearth/powershell-taglib)

## Summary

That's it.
