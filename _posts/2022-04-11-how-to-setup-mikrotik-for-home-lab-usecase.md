Your homelab can be powered from the network angle by different vendors, never the less for the price Mikrotik brings buch of functionalities which is worth the money. The interface may push you away a bit a first glimpse, but still it's worth investing a bit of time for the learning curve, especially being equipped with structualized content comming the TheNetworkBerg.

## Prerequisities
You need the following:
+ it will be beneficial if you have some networking backgorund, it will be a bit easier
+ need to spend some money on physical appliance, especially for the homelab usecase it is beneficial to have equippement which is not virutalized, it will pay off
## Where to find knowledge
There in incredible youtube channel worth donating created by [The Network Berg](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetworkBerg). 
He provides free MCTNA and more advanced trainings, bringing such level of detail which is enough for configuring your network device up to this extend that it can easily support your virtualized infrastructure or provide the service for your SOHO (small office home office) deployment.
The fact is that for the home lab, you do not need that great amount of routing, unless you are configuring a specific usecase, never the less for simple scenarios, products like RB951 series should be more than enough.

+ Mikrotik products can be found [here](https://mikrotik.com/products/)
+ Mikrotik free MCTNA training provided by TheNetworkBerg can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ7SGFemsLl3XQhO8g0hHCrKnC6J3KURk). Please toss him some coin, or become a Patron.
+ CCR series will definitelly bring great benefit for the overall configuration, never the less combination of RB and a CRS switch which will act as a L2 device will also suffice up to this extend that some interesting architectures can be built on top of that.
