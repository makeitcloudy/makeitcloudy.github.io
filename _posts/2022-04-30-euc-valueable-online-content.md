There is plenty of valuable content on the internet, which is created by the community, here are some of them which are worth following or watching. Keep calm and [do puzzles](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/jackson+pollock+jigsaw-puzzles).
It's impossible to list all names of great people who produce the valuable content and link it in one place, never the less it is a good starting point. The question which remains is the order to lay this down, constructively in memory. Apart from that each of us has it's topics which attracts him or her the most and it is the Team who builds the Virtual Workplace solutions, not the lonesome wariors or stars.

# Automation

League of Devops or Clickops.

## PowerShell

It's essential get comfortable with PowerShell, it will help you switch from imperative style of work towards declarative, when you get some hands on experience with DSC and Bicep. There are few great books about PowerShell as well as great quality content on the PowerShell advocates blogs.

## Azure Virtual Desktop

Before you start deploying any AVD infrastructure, it would be really convinient to get some understanding of the Storage, Networking, ActiveDirectory and a bit of AVD itself. At the time of writing this it is already possible to join the Host Pools to the Azure Active Directory never the less some scenarios needs the Active Directory Services and Hybrid join.
It would also be helpful to bring good and consistent naming convention:
