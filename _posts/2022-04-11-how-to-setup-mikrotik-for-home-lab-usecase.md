## Where to find knowledge
There in incredible youtube channel worth donating created by [The Network Berg](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetworkBerg). 
He provides free MCTNA and more advanced trainings, bringing such level of detail which is enough for configuring your network device up to this extend that it can easily support your virtualized infrastructure or provide the service for your SOHO (small office home office) deployment.
The fact is that for the home lab, you do not need that great amount of routing, unless you are configuring a specific usecase, never the less for simple scenarios, products like RB951 series should be more than enough.

+ CCR series will definitelly bring great benefit for the overall configuration, never the less combination of RB and a CRS switch which will act as a L2 device will also suffice up to this extend that some interesting architectures can be built on top of that.
