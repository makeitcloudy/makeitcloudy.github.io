In case you are interested in lowering the amount of wireless traffic in your nearby, there is an option.

## Prerequisities
I was testing this with following devices:
+ Asus Google Nexus 7 tablet 2017
+ LG Nexus 5 with GEMBIRD (P/N: NIC-mU2-01, EAN: 8716309090421)
+ Iphone 6S with FOINNEX LN-UE (ASIN: B07DPMGW4D)

## Howto
+ disable LTE
+ connect adapter to the usb or lightning port of your mobile
+ it should be recognized and you should be shown with icon like this <<->> which would mean that there should be a communication with your default gateway

## Summary
That's it
