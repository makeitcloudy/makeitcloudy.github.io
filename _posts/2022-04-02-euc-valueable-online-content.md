There is plenty of valuable content on the internet, which is created by the community, here are some of them which are worth following or watching. Keep calm and do ppuzzles](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/jackson+pollock+jigsaw-puzzles).
It's impossible to list all names of great people who produce the valuable content and link it in one place, never the less it is a good starting point. The question which remains is the order to lay this down, constructively in memory. Apart from that each of us has it's topics which attracts him or her the most and it is the Team who builds the Virtual Workplace solutions, not the lonesome wariors or stars.

Two Carl's - let's list them alphabetically: Carl Webster and Carl Stalhood
* Building Carl Webster lab [introduction](https://carlwebster.com/01-building-websters-lab-v2-introduction/) and the [massive pdf](https://carlwebster.com/building-websters-lab-v2-pdf/) - his guide contains 1335 pages. Imagine how much of an errort was made to bring this to life. It's available for free.
* [Carl Stalhood](https://www.carlstalhood.com/about-carl-stalhood/) - great resources and fair amount of links to other places which may bring you up to speed, along with tips for solving many of the issues which may arise, which are not well documented somewhere else.<br>
* [Freek Berson](https://github.com/fberson) and his [blog](http://microsoftplatform.blogspot.com/) - his blog post are great to lay down the foreground for Citrix which is nothing else than RDS (Remote Desktop Services), it seems to be good idea to start with Terminal Services and RDS which help structualize knowledge needed for a Citrix guy
* [MsFreaks](https://msfreaks.wordpress.com/)
* [Bas van Kaam](https://www.basvankaam.com/) - he is one of the Nerdio evangelist, who shared great green book called the FMA Architecture. Hat's off for the structualized content he brings.
* [Denis Span](https://dennisspan.com/) - he was my inspiration for some automation topics around PVS etc. His blog is full of examples how the installation of the components building CVAD can be automated. You may customize those scripts for your preference, for instance including the Error and Verbose streams, they are great starting point.

* [Dennis Mohrmann](https://github.com/Mohrpheus78/)

* [Esther Barthel](https://github.com/cognitionit) - if you are interested in REST API, Nitro for Citrix ADC and topics around automation, she is the one to follow
* [Julian Jakob](https://www.julianjakob.com/)

Many of abovementioned EUC experts, links on their blogs shares great tools which may improve your skills in your daily work, and reveal knowledge, which you'll never get on the trainings guarateed by the vendor, exposing their experience from the field. There are many more, please forgive me I can not enumerate them all here. Depending from the area, many are CTP's or MVP's, but there are also grey eminence personas who share valuable information.
